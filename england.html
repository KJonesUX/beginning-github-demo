          >It’s one of London’s best known and most loved dishes</span
        >, and quite possibly the greatest coupling of all time. But it’s also
        one of the hardest to get right. As such, London’s finest fried fish is
        lost in an ocean of greasy mediocrity, and its chips in a sea of
        sogginess.

        But like pearls in oysters, a good chippy does appear once in a while —
        one where the fish is always fresh, the batter crunchy and the chips
        fluffy. Here’s our pick of those pearls, all of which offer decent
        dining-in options as well as takeaway...

        The Bonnie Gull Seafood Shack in Fitzrovia has fish and chips on the
        menu — beer battered North Sea haddock and beef dripping chunky chips,
        to be exact. The batter is made using a Japanese tempura mix making it
        seriously crispy, while we found the fish within to be firm, meaty and
        moist. Homemade ketchup and mushy peas are final flourishes, while the
        seaside-style decor sets the scene perfectly.
